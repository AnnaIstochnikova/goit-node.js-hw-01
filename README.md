This project is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application built using Node.js that manages a contact list. It allows users to perform various operations such as listing contacts, adding new contacts, retrieving contacts by ID, and removing contacts from the list.

## Features:

Listing Contacts: View the entire list of contacts in a tabular format. Use "node index.js --action list".

Get Contact by ID: Retrieve a contact by specifying its unique identifier. Use "--action get --id superheroID".

Add Contact: Add a new contact to the existing contact list, including name, email, and phone. Try "node index.js --action add --name WonderWoman --email wonder @hero.com --phone 123-456-7890".

Remove Contact: Delete a contact from the list using its unique ID. Use "node index.js --action remove --id villainID".
